## Introduction
1. **YY** is the school year (e.g. **17**, **18**...).
1. The repository [**vvv-school/vvv{yy}**](#set-up-vvvyy-school-repository) represents the "hall" of the school, that is the school entry point. It's where we handle the Wiki, the Q&A system, school material (e.g. links to slides) and, generally, all the resources we need. With [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) we can render the hall quite nicely.
1. Each day we'll run a **course** (e.g. kinematics, dynamics, vision...) that consists in teaching theories during **frontal lessons** so as giving [**hands-on**](#hands-on) sessions.
1. Teachers have two instruments during hands-on and/or lessons: [**tutorials**](#tutorials) and [**assignments**](#assignments). They correspond to single repositories stored in [**vvv-school** organization](https://github.com/vvv-school).
1. Teachers make use of [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com) to invite students to follow tutorials and solve assignments. To this end, each teacher is required to set up a new organization where students' assignments will be created by means of _automatic sandboxing_ through [**GitHub Classrooms**](https://classroom.github.com/help).
1. Provided that there are many attendees, we cannot afford to do [**code review**](../instructions/how-to-complete-assignments.md#collaborative-code-review-1) on a student basis. Alternatively, we can resort to [**automatic grading**](#automatic-grading) to challenge students and let teachers understand which of them falls behind, thus needing help.
1. Material specific to _VVV{YY} School_ can be conveniently put inside **vvv{yy}** repository. Instead, for collecting **courses material** that can be _recycled yearly_, we can either rely on **individual repositories** hosted at [**vvv-school** organization](https://github.com/vvv-school) (call it **material_**_something_), or on external resources we can link to. Please, don't use [vvv-school.github.io](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io) for such kind of storage, since slides can be easily very unwieldy.

## Set up VVV{YY} School repository
The repository will be named **vvv-school/vvv{yy}** (e.g. [vvv-school/vvv17](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv17)).

Everything is already mostly done, since we can [**import** the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/importing-a-repository-with-github-importer) **vvv{yy-1}** into **vvv{yy}**. Note that **importing** seems a better choice than **forking**: we break up any _subtle relationship_ between the two repositories.

Then, do the following steps:
- If you didn't do it while creating the new repository, edit the **description** and the **website** fields of the repository page with, respectively, **Resources for VVV{YY} School** and **https://vvv-school.github.io/vvv{yy}**.
- Within [vvv-school](https://github/vvv-school), [create two **teams**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-team): **vvv{yy}-teachers** and **vvv{yy}-students**; assign them [vvv-teachers](https://github.com/orgs/vvv-school/teams/vvv-teachers) and [vvv-students](https://github.com/orgs/vvv-school/teams/vvv-students), respectively, as parent teams. Then, fill in the teams with the corresponding members. Remember that teams visibility is restricted to the organization's members, hence don't spread out links that non-members won't be able to access. In particular, **vvv{yy}-students** will be used during [**automatic grading**](#automatic-grading).
- Add up **vvv{yy}-students** as [**team with read permission**](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-team-access-to-an-organization-repository) to **vvv{yy}** and [unselect **Restrict edits to collaborators only**](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-access-permissions-for-wikis), so that students can edit the Wiki.
- Replace all the links in **README.md**, **teachers.md** and **students.md** files accordingly.
- Create a [**welcome issue**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv17/issues/1) in **Q&A**. Don't forget to replace links therein too.
- Replicate the same **Wiki** of **vvv{yy-1}** repository; it's quite slim and it shouldn't require a big effort :wink: In particular, you need to fill in the home page and create one further page containing the [**instructions to follow before arriving at VVV**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv17/wiki/Before-arriving-at-VVV) (link this page from home). Possibly, recall that wikis are bare git repositories that can be easily cloned.
- [Configure the **GitHub Pages**](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages) to publish from the **`master`** branch. The file **`_config.yml`** used by GitHub Pages to set up the style should be already contained inside (thanks to duplication). This way, the website of the resources of VVV{YY} School will be published at https://vvv-school.github.io/vvv{yy} (e.g. https://vvv-school.github.io/vvv17).
- Fill in the file **gradebook.md** with proper links to the GitHub page of the [courses repositories](#vvvyy-school-courses-repositories).

## Set up VVV{YY} School courses organizations
During **vvv{yy}** school, teachers will be giving **frontal lessons** and **hands-on sessions** regarding diverse courses, e.g. **kinematics**, **dynamics**, **vision** and so on.

### Hands-on
**Hands-on** are repositories stored in [**vvv-school** organization](https://github.com/vvv-school), which we handle using the [**GitHub Education**](https://education.github.com) platform.

There are two categories of hands-on:

#### Tutorials
>A tutorial is a repository containing complete code used to explain a particular aspect of the course. During lessons and/or hands-on, teachers and students can work on it together. Tutorials will be therefore assigned within the classroom, even though students are not required to provide any solution (the code is complete); thus, their score is low (e.g. **1,2**). A tutorial may or may not provide a [**smoke-test**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io/blob/master/instructions/how-to-complete-assignments.md#smoke-testing); at any rate, it won't be counted by [**automatic grading**](#automatic-grading) process.
>
>[**tutorial_cartesian-interface**](https://github.com/vvv-school/tutorial_cartesian-interface) is an example of tutorial you can design yours from.
>
>Be tidy and call your tutorials with the prefix **tutorial_**.

#### Assignments
>An assignment is a repository that contains **starter code** the students are required to complete with their own solutions. To run the [**automatic grading**](#automatic-grading) process based on assignments, teachers responsible for the course need to code a [**smoke-test**](https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io/blob/master/instructions/how-to-complete-assignments.md#smoke-testing) inside the assignment. Typically, assignments have higher scores (e.g. **> 2**) depending on their difficulty.
>
>Students can follow these [general **instructions**](../instructions/how-to-complete-assignments.md#instructions-for-students) to complete the assignments; in particular, the section on [**Smoke Testing**](../instructions/how-to-complete-assignments.md#smoke-testing) that will help check whether the assignment can be considered passed. Also, an assignment contains **specific instructions** (within _README.md_) detailing how students should proceed with the code. Note that nothing prevents a teacher from accepting an assignment himself and solve it together with students. Teachers are suggested to store a possible solution to the assignment as a **private repository** within [**vvv-school** organization](https://github.com/vvv-school) (let's call it **solution_**_name-of-assignment_).
>
>[**assignment_make-it-roll**](https://github.com/vvv-school/assignment_make-it-roll) is an example of assignment you can design yours from.
>
>Be tidy and call your assignments with the prefix **assignment_**.

Thereby, to deal with students hands-on for each course, we have to create the dedicated organization **vvv{yy}-{course}**. This choice allows us to use a [**GitHub Classroom**](https://classroom.github.com) specific to each course as well as to avoid cluttering the main [**vvv-school** organization](https://github.com/vvv-school) with lots of students repositories that will be automatically generated by means of the classroom process.

Therefore, for each course, do:
- [Create the **organization**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch) **vvv{yy}-{course}**.
- It's not strictly necessary to give all teachers read/write permissions to the organization: one maintainer per course is enough :wink:
- [Create a brand new **classroom**](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/new) on top of **vvv{yy}-{course}**. First, grant GitHub access to **vvv{yy}-{course}**.

### VVV{YY} School courses repositories
Each course is managed through a **course repository**, which is thus named **vvv{yy}-{course}/vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io** and aims to automatically handle the **course gradebook**.

Then, let's create this last repository! Also here, everything is already mostly done: you can [**create the repository**](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) **vvv{yy}-{course}/vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io** from the template [**vvv-school/template_vvvyy-course.github.io**](https://github.com/vvv-school/template_vvvyy-course.github.io).

To start with, you need to apply the following changes:

- Edit the **description** and the **website** fields of the repository page.
- **GitHub Pages** are already enabled by default, given the chosen name of the repository. The file **`_config.yml`** used by GitHub Pages to set up the style should be already contained inside (thanks to duplication).
- Edit the first line of [**README.md**](https://github.com/vvv-school/template_vvvyy-course.github.io/blob/master/README.md) file. The rest of the file will be overwritten by the [**automatic grading**](#automatic-grading) process.
- Edit the _organization's name_ so as the the _students' team name_ within the [**gadebook.sh**](https://github.com/vvv-school/template_vvvyy-course.github.io/blob/master/gradebook.sh#L11-L12) script.
- **Pin the repository** to the organization.
- Remember to put a link to _https://vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io_ inside **vvv-school/vvv{yy}/gradebook.md**.

#### Gear up for automatic grading
Finally, you have to fill in the **data.json** file containing info on **tutorials** and **assignments** regarding this particular **{course}**.

The format is pretty much intuitive. Here's an example:
```json
{
    "tutorials": [
        {
            "name": "tutorial_gaze-interface",
            "url": "https://github.com/vvv-school/tutorial_gaze-interface.git",
            "score": 1
        },
        {
            "name": "tutorial_cartesian-interface",
            "url": "https://github.com/vvv-school/tutorial_cartesian-interface.git",
            "score": 1
        }      
    ],
    
    "assignments": [
        {
            "name": "assignment_make-it-roll",
            "url": "https://github.com/vvv-school/assignment_make-it-roll.git",
            "score": 5
        }    
    ]    
}
```
:warning: Be careful, a repository can be **listed only once**.

## Automatic grading

**Automatic grading** is a process that runs continuously in background to collect information from students submissions to then publish results nicely.

We have to go through two steps:

### Challenge students
Once you're all set, you can [create an **individual assignment**](https://education.github.community/t/video-setting-up-individual-assignments/2150) from the dashboard of your **GitHub Classroom**.

These are the settings we have to use:
- **Your assignment title**: make up a name; it's not that significant.
- **Your assignment repository prefix**: :warning: must be equal to the name of the **starter code** (e.g. _assignment_make-it-roll_)
- Tick on **Public** :heavy_check_mark: Choose _Private_ only if you really aim to prevent students from inspiring each other :wink:
- **Don't give students** _Admin permissions_ on their repository :x:
- **Add your starter code from GitHub**: pick up your tutorial or assignment from [**vvv-school**](https://github.com/vvv-school). **Autocompletion** is available to help you out :octocat:
- Tick on **Import starter code using a template repository** :heavy_check_mark: to get [reliability and performance boost](https://github.blog/2019-08-27-github-classroom-gets-a-reliability-and-performance-boost) :zap: Make sure beforehand that the starter code is a [template repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-template-repository), actually.

You'll be given an **invitation link** :link: you shall now share with students. The easiest and the most collaborative way is to post it on the **Q&A** system https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv{yy}/issues or as a new [team discussion](https://github.com/blog/2471-introducing-team-discussions). The latter way allows keeping invitation links :lock: visible only to team members.

Repeat the process for all the hands-on you have in your course. It can be done all at once, or progressively, depending on the pace that suits you best.

At this point, students can follow these [general **instructions**](../instructions/how-to-complete-assignments.md#instructions-for-students) to complete the assignments; in particular, the section on [**Smoke Testing**](../instructions/how-to-complete-assignments.md#smoke-testing).

In case you, the teacher, decide to solve an assignment together with students, proceed as follows:
- **click on the invitation link** to accept the assignment yourself;
- during the hands-on, work within the newly created repository alongside with students;
- highlight the use of **smoke-test**;
- your contribution won't be put on the bill during automatic grading, since you're not a member of **vvv{yy}-students** team.

#### How to assign scores incrementally
By default, each assignment comes with its own score ─ as specified in the file [**data.json**](#gear-up-for-automatic-grading) ─ that gets assigned to the student if his solution has passed the smoke-test. Nonetheless, assignments with a variable outcome in terms of score are also possible.

It is sufficient to accumulate the score within the **smoke-test** (for example in the variable `score`) according to some given performance criteria of e.g. increasing difficulty and, finally, output the **exact string** here below using the directive [`ROBOTTESTINGFRAMEWORK_TEST_CHECK`](http://robotology.gitlab.io/docs/rtf/master/index.html):
```cpp
ROBOTTESTINGFRAMEWORK_TEST_CHECK(score>0,Asserter::format("Total score = %d",score));
```
This output score will override what is contained in **data.json**. Importantly, the output score must be in the range **[1,100]** in order to be correctly recognized.

An example is available in [assignment_control-pid](https://github.com/vvv-school/assignment_control-pid/blob/master/smoke-test/test.cpp).

### Update the gradebook
We use a **Linux system** to run the script for the automatic grading.

#### Prerequisites
- you have to [store **git credentials**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Credential-Storage) locally, to let git push without keeping prompting for login.

  >To store credentials for one hour:
  >```sh
  >$ git config [options] credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  >```
  >To flush the cache earlier:
  >```sh
  >$ git credential-cache exit
  >```
  >To store credentials forever (or until you erase):
  >```sh
  >$ git config [options] credential.helper store
  >```
  >To unset storing credentials:
  >```sh
  >$ git config [options] --unset-all credential.helper
  >```
  >`options` can be:
    >- `--local` affecting only the current git directory.
    >- `--global` affecting all git directories of the current user.
    >- `--system` affecting all git directories on the system.

- Additionally, you have to be a **OAuth user** with `repo` and `admin:org` full scopes to retrieve via [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3) reserved information regarding teams, private repositories, create commit statuses as well as increase the _rate limit_ of our requests. To do so, after you created a [personal access token on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use), save the token in the environment variable **GITHUB_TOKEN_VVV_SCHOOL**:
  
  ```sh
  $ export GITHUB_TOKEN_VVV_SCHOOL=token-hash-goes-here
  ```
  
  If you don't want to mess up with your user account credentials, you might consider being the [**@vvv-school-bot**](https://github.com/vvv-school-bot) instead :wink: (ask [**@pattacini**](https://github.com/pattacini) to get one _access token_). To this aim, invite [**@vvv-school-bot**](https://github.com/vvv-school-bot) as owner of **vvv{yy}-{course}** organization.
- Make sure that [**jq**](https://stedolan.github.io/jq) and [**octokit**](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) are installed:

  ```sh
  $ sudo apt install jq
  $ sudo apt install ruby
  $ sudo gem install octokit
  ```

#### Launch the script
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vvv{yy}-{course}/vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io.git
$ cd vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io
$ ./gradebook.sh
```

The gradebook will be published online at the course webpage: _https://vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io_.

#### GitHub Webooks
**Optionally**, one may set up a **webhook** that will trigger grading only upon detection of specific events involving any hands-on repository (i.e. containing _tutorial_ or _assignment_ keywords) hosted at the organization. This procedure will prevent from polling GitHub continuosly as it is well described in the [GitHub Developer Guide](https://developer.github.com/webhooks).

In short, we need to:
1. Create the webhook within the **vvv{yy}-{course}** organization. Use the following options to fill in the configuration fields:
    - payload URL: `http://[host-name|host-ip]:4567/payload` (or any valid port in place of `4567` as specified when launching the Sinatra server - see below);
    - content type: `application/json`;
    - secret: leave it empty;
    - select individual triggering events:
        - [x] `Pushes`
        - [x] `Repositories`
        - [x] `Repository imports`
    - :white_check_mark: mark the webhook active.
1. Make sure that the grading server has [**sinatra**](https://rubygems.org/gems/sinatra) and [**json**](https://rubygems.org/gems/json) gems. To this end, if they are not listed by doing `gem list`, then install them:
    ```sh
    $ sudo gem install sinatra
    $ sudo gem install json
    ```
1. On the grading machine, launch the Sinatra server prior to launching the gradebook script:
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/vvv-school/vvv-school.github.io.git
    $ ./vvv-school.github.io/scripts/on-event.rb [port]
    ```
    The parameter `port` is optional (equal to `4567` if not given).
    
## VVV{YY} School wrap-up
Once the school is over, we have to:

- Use [GitHub Records Archiver](https://github.com/benbalter/github-records-archiver) or rely on the [GitHub Classroom Assistant](https://classroom.github.com/assistant) to back up the students repositories of **vvv{yy}-{course}** organization. Alternatively, you may want to explore the tools offered by the [GitHub Migration API](https://developer.github.com/v3/migrations).
- Make a zip of the output archive and protect it with a password (use the same password of [**@vvv-school-bot**](https://github.com/vvv-school-bot)). Consider splitting the zip in several archives, given that GitHub has [limitations for large files](https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-large-files/#conditions-for-large-files).
- Push the resulting bunch of archives to **vvv{yy}-{course}/vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io/archives** directory and insert the following note in the _README.md_: `As VVV{YY} is now over, the students repositories have been archived.`
- [Archive](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-a-github-repository) **vvv{yy}-{course}/vvv{yy}-{course}.github.io**.
- [Archive](https://help.github.com/articles/archiving-a-github-repository) **vvv-school/vvv{yy}**.
- Delete all the students repositories in each **vvv{yy}-{course}** organization. To do so, it is sufficient to delete the **GitHub Classroom** associated to the organization. This is to prevent students of **VVV{YY+1} School** from inspecting solutions contained in **vvv{yy}-course** :smirk:
- Replace teachers with [**@vvv-school-bot**](https://github.com/vvv-school-bot) as single owner of **vvv{yy}-{course}** organizations. This way, we spare teachers the burden of being subscribed to organizations that are no longer necessary, while retaining the same organizations as records of the past courses.
- Mark in time all the relevant repositories hosted in [vvv-school](https://github/vvv-school) with the tag `vvv{yy}` (and the annotation `code used during vvv{yy}`) using the script [`create-tag`](/scripts/create-tag.rb).
